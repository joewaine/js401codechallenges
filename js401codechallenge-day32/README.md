see solution.png for my 'whiteboarding solution!'

problem domain:
write recursive and iterative function to calculate fib(n)

tests:
tests for negative vals
test for the n value being a valid number type
spot chekcs to verify solution

pseudo code:

recursive:
base:
f(0)=> 0
f(1)=> 1

recursive:
F(n-1)+ F(n-2)


iterative

build from bottom up using a programming method that is dynamic

create an array as you go for spot checking

prevent multiple calculations of the same val
