## Whiteboard Challenge 02

Complete today's whiteboard challenge and follow the submission instructions below:

*Write a function that takes in a numeric array and returns an object literal with two properties:*
    - The highest and second highest value in the array


	this passes correctly. see my pseudo code image in this directory: 'solution-day-02.jpg'


*Write at least four tests for this function*
		- Your tests should cover basic functionality
		- Consider any edge cases for your function, e.g. will your function still operate on an array of floating point integers?

	*my tests*
	does the array return an answer? [passes]
	is the input not null? [passes]
	does the array have more than two items? [passes]
	are all of the inputs numbers? [pass]


*this was a great challenge for getting an understanding of jest and the process of setting modules*
