README.md - code challenge

Write a function const traverse = (engine) => {... which takes the engine as a starting location. Travel from the engine to the caboose, and total the number of passengers in each car as your progress. return the final total once your traversal is complete.

Each car, including the engine will have the following signature: js { <engine> value: 2, next: { <next car> value: 16, next: { <next car> } }

Problem:
Write a function that takes in an object and counts the number of passengers on the train.

Tests:

Test if there is an input

Test if the input is an object

Test for the intended answer to be returned.

Test if the values in the entered object are numbers.


*Reflection*
This challenge was a great refresher in the recursion concept. Writing tests is getting much more familiar, looking forward to moving forward!!!
