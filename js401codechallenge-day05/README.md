instructions:

Write a function that returns the middle node in a singly linked list

Given [25, nxt]->[01, nxt]->[15, nxt]->[33, nxt]->[04, nxt]

Return [15, nxt]


the point of this challenge was to return the middle node value of a linked list. i am able to console.log the answer but for some reason in my tests i am not able to get a pass for the correct input/output combination. see my whiteboarding process in this folder. (solution.jpg)
