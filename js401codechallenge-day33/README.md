I paid close attention to making sure valid parameters were supplied to this function.

It is good to create fail safe, stress capable functions for practice - this challenge checks out and works great.

Requirements
Write a function while takes two arguments, a base number and an exponential, and returns the sum of the return value's digits.

For example: fn(2, 15) => 32768 => 26

Write at least four tests for this function

your tests should cover basic (expected) functionality
your tests should consider edge cases for your function (ex: will your function still operate on an array of floating point integers?)
