Problem Domain:
Return the intersects of two given arrays.

Pseudo code:

1 - create function accepting two arrays as args

2 - for loop to cycle through each index & see if the 2nd array contains current index.

3 - If array 2 contains indexOf array 1, push to empty array and return it.


Tests:

1 - expecvted output for valid input

2 - correct response to empty arrays

3 - multiple intersects of same input


*Reflection*
We made great use of the 'includes' array method for this challenge. All tests passed - good practice indeed.
