problem domain:

write a function that takes two BSTs and returns true if they are same in structure, false if not

test:
valid inputs?
valid outputs? (true or false)

pseudo code:

- implement preOrderTraverse 
that consists of zero if there is a node, and one if there IS a node

- preOrderTraverse each BST, 

compare if the returned arrays are the same, returning true or false
